    <p class="text-muted">A church is a public place of worship, usually for people of the Christian religion. Some Christian denominations, or groups, also have buildings called cathedrals. A cathedral serves as the central, or main, church for a geographical area.

      The layout and design of churches can vary greatly. Still, many churches share some common features.
      
      Most churches include an altar, or a raised platform. The people who perform the religious services are called the clergy. They stand at the altar during the services.
      
      All churches have a seating area for the congregation, or people attending services in the church. Usually people sit in long wooden benches called pews. Some churches have separate seating areas for the choir, or people who sing at church.
      
      Many churches have a bell tower containing one or more bells. The bells ring before and after services, to celebrate religious holidays, and sometimes to mark the time of day. Many churches also have stained glass windows. These colorful windows often show stories from the Bible.
      
      Protestant churches tend to be more simple in their design than Roman Catholic churches and cathedrals. Protestant churches usually have fewer religious statues and other decorations as well.</p>

  <h5 class="text-muted text-capitalize"> Was build in 1980</h5>
  <p class="text-muted">Library is a place that stores a variety of books.

     My school has a big library, situated near the auditorium.
    
     Our class visits the library once a week.
    
     Various storybooks, novels, comics, etc are present in our library.
    
     I eagerly wait for the library period because I love reading storybooks.
    
     My school library has a large table to sit and read surrounded by bookshelves.
    
     When we get any assignments, we use books from our library.
    
     I also spend my free periods in school library.
    
     We can also issue books from the library for a few days.
    
     In my school library, we all are requested to maintain pin-drop silence.></p>

  <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>School auditorium</kbd></h4>
  <hr>
  <h5 class="text-muted text-capitalize"> Was build in 1982</h5>
  <p class="text-muted">I read in a very big school. Likewise, it has a big hall. It is also known as the auditorium. It has a sound-proof system in it such that any voice or sound in it does not echo awfully.

    It is situated in the main building in the centre of the school. It has five doors and a number of windows. It is air-conditioned but has electric fans also which are put to work if ever the AC system fails. They are also worked with a generator when there is an electric breakdown and the AC system does not work.
    
    There is a vast dais at the end of the hall. The dais is quite high and there are stairs to climb it has a curtain for dramatic performances. There is also a lecture stand there for the speakers. A mike is there which is put to use when necessary.
    
    The front door is the widest. The four other doors two in the either wall are comparatively less wide. Besides, there are two small doors behind the dais which open into small green houses.
    
    
    At the time of any function, sofas and chairs are installed on the stage, that is, dais. Chairs and benches are then also installed in the entire hall for students. Only participants, senior teachers and VIPs sit on the sofas and chairs on the dais.
    
    At the time of school functions such as annual prize distribution, variety show, fancy dress show, speech-making, debates, seminars, workshops, declamation contests, quiz contests, etc. some prominent citizens are also invited.
    
    Our school hall being quite spacious long is known to be a suitable place for holding such functions as inter-school contests, blood donation camps, various disease awareness campaigns such as pulse polio, tuberculosis control, leprosy control, etc. It is also sometimes used by the district administration for conferences, etc.
